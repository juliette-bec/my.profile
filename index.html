  <h1> Hi ! I'm Juliette 🙋</h1>
  <p> I'm a 18 year-old french girl, and I am currently a business school student. 
I was born on June the 4th of 2002 in Toulouse, in the South of France. I unfortunatly don't have the southern accent :(
My nickname at ESSEC is Flamme because of my red hair, and my temperament like fire🔥. I am very generous, open-minded and I love meeting new people, but I trust a small number of friends 👥

  <h2> Hobbies </h2>
  <p>
 I am passionate about art, like theater, museums, litterature ... Those are the things I miss the most during this Covid-time.                                                             
 I love listening to music.                                                               
 I have been practicing fencing, fitness, golf and horse-riding in my life. 
 I have been a scout-girl for 7 years, it was a really great experience. 
 I love being aware of the newest tendencies, I love fashion and luxury brands (even if I can't afford them hahaha)

  <h2> Parties </h2>
  <p>
  I love to party and go out with my friends, even if I don't drink alcohol ! 
  I also like to do picnics outdoors, and just talk about everything with the persons I love the most in my life.

  <h2> Travel </h2>
  <p>
  I travel a lot, I love it ✈️.
  I went to Spain, Italy, Great-Britain, United States, Morocco, Greece, Netherlands, Dominican Republic and some other countries. 🌍 If I could have a job in an international firm, it would be so great !
